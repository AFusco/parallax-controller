# Parallax Controller: Introduction

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/parallax-controller.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/parallax-controller) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jscottsmith/parallax-controller/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/jscottsmith/parallax-controller)

Core classes and controller for creating parallax scrolling effects. Designed to provide scroll based animations for elements relative to the view. Built for performance by caching important attributes that cause reflow and layout when accessing.

## NPM Package

Via Yarn

```bash
yarn add parallax-controller
```

or NPM

```bash
npm add parallax-controller
```

## Demos

This package was created for [react-scroll-parallax](https://github.com/jscottsmith/react-scroll-parallax), but can be used as a standalone lib. Most demos were built with `react-scroll-parallax`.
